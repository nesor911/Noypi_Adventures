* Tikbalang scare travelers or play tricks on them which leads them away from the right path. They are durable creatures, killing it with a gun is easy but stepping on it is just like horse riding.

* Ghosts are spectral, ethereal beings who are the lingering remnants of those who have died. Ghosts are scary and invincible, but because Noy has a natural affiliation with ghosts, he can touch them, but only on their heads.
