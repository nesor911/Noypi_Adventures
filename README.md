# Project Description
This game design document describes the details for a multi-platform based 2D side scrolling platformer game where players run left to right to reach the goal. This platformer game enables the character to jump across platforms, fight with melee weapons or shoot with ranged ones in order to fend-off against enemies.

# Characters
* Noy Pilegro is the main character of the story where he fights for his loved ones and for his town against the monsters lurking in the shadows.

* Manananggal is scary, often hideous, usually depicted as female, and always capable of severing its upper torso and sprouting huge bat-like wings to fly. Manananggal can be killed by bullets or jumping on their head (will bounce on the head).

* Tikbalang scare travelers or play tricks on them which leads them away from the right path. They are durable creatures, killing it with a gun is easy but stepping on it is just like horse riding.

* Ghosts are spectral, ethereal beings who are the lingering remnants of those who have died. Ghosts are scary and invincible, but because Noy has a natural affiliation with ghosts, he can touch them, but only on their heads.
